pdferl
======

An erlang library for fast creation of pdf, xls or rtf files

dependencies
======

You will need:

ruby (latest version)

rubygems and gem erlectricity

java (latest version)

erlang R14B03 or later

before start
======

A template must be created in iReport. 

Template must has extension .jasper.

Template must be placed on reports directory.

You must build template using xml as datasource.

You must know the xpath used to build the template.

clone and compile
======

Clone:

			$ git clone https://github.com/jorgegarrido/pdferl.git
			
Into pdferl

			$ cd pdferl
			
Compile:

			$ make compile

starting & configuring pdferl
======

To start pdferl inside your application or directly from an erlang shell use:

			application:start(pdferl)
			
It will start pdferl but you need configure the path where created files will be placed,
this configuration is on priv directory on pdferl.conf
The path to store files directory must be an absolute path, example:

		%%
		%% Configure the path used to store where
		%% created files will be placed.
		%%
		{store_path, "/path/where/store/files/"}

setting templates on correct directory
======

Your jasper templates must be set on priv/reports directory since pdferl reads from this 
directory the templates.

using pdferl inside my application
======

After pdferl has been started, you just call a single function:
	
			> ok = pdferl:create(Args).

The Args passed to function are in a single tuple, and it must look like this:

			> Args = {Xml, Xpath, JasperFile, NameFile, TypeFile}.
			
Xml : the xml in erlang string format.

Xpath : the xpath used by jasper when you build the template report.

JasperFile : the jasper file (template report).

NameFile : the name file that pdf, xls or rtf will be set.

TypeFile : pdf, xls or rtf.

Now a file has been created, but pdferl can notify you if it is true, the in your code,
you must implement a simple receive for process:

			do_recv() ->
			    receive
        			{response, <<"ok">>} -> ok
    			end.
    			
The tuple {response, <<"ok">>} is sent by pdferl to you, when you receive this, you ensure that file
(pdf, xls or rtf) has been created correctly.

xml creation
======

You can use xml module to create xml format, the function encode on this takes as input a proplist,
also the function set_header sets the  correct header for a xml format, example:

			> TagPerson = [{name, "name here!"}, {last_name, "last name here!"}, {age, "00"}].
			...
			> xml:set_header(xml:encode([{document, [{people, [{person, TagPerson}]}]}])).
			"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?><document><people><person><name>name here!....

examples
======

Let's compile the examples placed under directory example

			$ make example
			
Now let's create a xls or pdf using the examples:

			> sample_xls:make().
			  ok_created_succesfully
	
If the response was ok, then the file has been placed in reports directory, sweet!!

known bugs
======

Sometimes when a jasper template is created, the fonts in the host where pdferl is running are not available.
To solve the problem install the correct fonts to your host.
